/*Let's continue with our football betting app!

1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exaclty like this:
      Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
      Odd of draw: 3.25
      Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw"). HINT: Note how the odds and the game objects have the same property names ðŸ˜‰
